<h1><a name="what" id="what"></a>What UNAPOOP is<br />
</h1>
<br />
<p><em>“Some people aren’t prepared to play; to engage with one another in an imaginative way; to give in to those beautiful childhood instincts for unfettered fun. It’s a sickness. A mental illness with horrendous side effects. Take out ‘play’ and what have people got to do all day?</em></p>

<p><em>Money earning. Power hankering. Land grabbing. War mongering. Religious crusading. That’s what people spend time on, when life’s not all swings and roundabouts.”</em></p>

<p>- Dr Professor Hornhon Hototototot PhD</p>
<br />

<p><em>“When a fully grown adult, waiting at the bus stop, asks a stranger if they would like a game of tig and is point-blank refused (as well as being given a ‘funny’ look), it is clear that something is wrong with our society.”</em></p>

<p>- Sir Alan Sugar</p>

<br />

<p><em>“Only a play-full world, begets a peace-full one.”</em></p>

<p>- Anne Egg</p>

<br />

<p><img src="bull.jpg" width="10" height="10" /> &nbsp; UNAPOOP recognises that due to specific factors our sense of playfulness is suppressed as we grow; by parents, peers, employers, and purveyors</p>

<p><img src="bull.jpg" width="10" height="10" /> &nbsp; UNAPOOP understands that this suppression affects the nature of our society and that without play-full there can be no peace-full</p>

<p><img src="bull.jpg" width="10" height="10" /> &nbsp; UNAPOOP works to permeate playfulness into adulthood, addressing the barriers that inhibit its assimilation </p>

<h1><a name="how" id="how"></a>How UNAPOOP happened</h1>

<p><strong>11th of December 1946</strong> -The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is formed for the benefit of supporting - in various ways - the World’s children.</p>

<p><strong>10th of December 1959</strong> -The International Declaration of the Rights of the Child is adopted by the UN General Assembly. One of the core principles being:</p>

<p><em>‘The child shall have full opportunity for play and…society and the public authorities shall endeavour to promote the enjoyment of this right.’</em></p>

<p><strong>30th of January 2013</strong> - Finally recognising that this principle is equally as critical to the wellbeing of the World’s fully-grown population, the United Nations Association for Playfulness Of Older Peoples (UNAPOOP) is formed.</p>

<p><strong>3rd-24th August 2013 </strong>- A comic theatre production, ‘Listen, Lancelot…’ part-funded by UNAPOOP is staged at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Venue 63, Dragonfly, 52 West Port, EH1 2LD. Show time 22:10 daily. Free entry.</p>
